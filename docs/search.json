I am a native Ohioan, having grown up in Canton, and a double alumnus of CWRU, having earned my B.A. in Anthropology and Master of Public Health degrees from here as well.\nMy research interests lie primarily around working to improve health outcomes and care access within minoritized communities. For my MPH capstone project, I developed a study using community-based system dynamics methods to understand the connection between intergenerational trauma and mental health in adult children of South Asian immigrants. I also worked as a research assistant on a project titled “Understanding Psilocybin (‘Magic Mushrooms’) In the Context of the Modern Psychedelic Renaissance,” for which I performed media analyses and conducted ethnographic interviews of psilocybin users.\nIn addition to my research experience, I seek out other academic, professional, and social involvements. I have served as a TA for graduate and undergraduate public health classes, held leadership positions in undergraduate clubs related to health and wellness, participated actively in service projects – such as helping to construct a free library and pantry on campus – and been a member of the Delta Gamma sorority, where I was able to further develop my mentorship skills. Currently, I am the program representative for the MS Biostatistics program within the Biomedical Graduate Student Organization.\nApart from school – who am I? Having been a student for the last 20 years, this question can sometimes feel difficult to answer. While I am a passionate lifelong learner and aspiring social epidemiologist, I am also a daughter, sister, friend, animal-lover, amateur chef, thrill-seeker, writer, world-traveler, and so much more. I invite you to explore my website, where you will find my CV, current projects, and contact info!"
